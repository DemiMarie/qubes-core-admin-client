"""API for various types of devices.

Main concept is that some domain main
expose (potentially multiple) devices, which can be attached to other domains.
Devices can be of different classes (like 'pci', 'usb', etc.). Each device
class is implemented by an extension.

Devices are identified by pair of (backend domain, `port_id`), where `port_id`
is :py:class:`str`.
